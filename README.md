# Building a Weather Data Dashboard (SURE Internship)
Notebooks from my SURE Internship at Space Park Leicester 

This repository contains all the finalised and working notebooks from my time on my SURE internship, with comments such that it can be understood by others.

**For ECMWF data**, please use the notebook provided by ECMWF. It is much higher quality than the one I made personally, link here: https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-opendata

There were various other things that I started to work on but are currently incomplete so I ommitted them. However if you would like to hear about them please feel free to ask 


These include:

Extracting Pollen data from ADS

Working with Los Gatos Data
